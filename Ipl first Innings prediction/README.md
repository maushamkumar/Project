## Project Overview
• Created a model that predicts the score (in terms of range) of IPL matches<br/>
• Optimized Multiple-Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost regression models using GridsearchCV

## How will this project help?
• This project is for the fantasy cricket fans out there, helping them to earn extra fantasy points for Dream11 IPL 2020

## Resources Used
• Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn<br/>
• Dataset by **Shivam Mitra**: https://github.com/codophobia/CricketScorePredictor

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
• **Removing unwanted columns**<br/>
• **Keeping only consistent teams**<br/>
• **Removing the first 5 overs data in every match**<br/>
• **Converting the column 'date' from string into datetime object**<br/>
• **Handling categorical features**

## Model Building and Evaluation
Evaluation metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)<br/>
• Multiple Linear Regression - 15.843 <br/>
• Decision Tree - 23.044<br/>
• Random Forest - 18.171<br/>
• **Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) - 15.798**


## Future Scope
• Add columns in dataset of top batsmen and bowlers of all the teams.<br/>
• Add columns that consists of striker and non-striker's strike rates.<br/>
• Implement this problem statement using Artificial Neural Network (ANN).<br/>
